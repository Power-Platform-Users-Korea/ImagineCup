## 📖 Project Overview

This project is an **AI assistant protecting workers' legitimate unemployment benefits rights**. A 24/7 AI legal consultation service defending workers from recent cases of unfair forced resignation (Coupang, London Bagel Museum, etc.), illegal dismissal, and rights violations.

**Key Features:**
- 🚨 Immediate emergency response (forced resignation letters, unfair pressure)
- ⚖️ Identify and alert unfair situations
- 📝 Guide evidence collection (recording, documents, witnesses)
- 🔗 Connect to free legal aid organizations
- 💪 Guide unemployment benefits eligibility
- 📚 Provide basic labor law knowledge

---

## ⚠️ Important Legal Disclaimer

**This service is an AI-powered information tool and does NOT replace professional legal advice.**

- ✅ **General Information**: Unemployment benefits system, basic labor law guidance
- ✅ **Emergency Response Guide**: Immediate actions to take in risky situations
- ✅ **Professional Referral**: Free legal aid organization information

- ❌ **NOT Legal Advice**: Consult professionals for legal judgment on individual cases
- ❌ **NOT Litigation Support**: Legal procedures require attorney/labor specialist consultation

**Emergency Contacts:**
- Ministry of Employment and Labor: **1350** (Weekdays 09:00-18:00)
- Korea Legal Aid Corporation: **132** (Free legal support)

**Always consult with professionals for specific legal matters.**

## 🚨 Why This Project is Needed

### Recent Reality in Korea

**Coupang Incident (2024)**:
- Forced "voluntary resignation" on thousands of workers
- Stripped unemployment benefits eligibility
- Workers were unaware of their rights

**London Bagel Museum Case**:
- Avoided unemployment benefits without proper dismissal procedures
- Violated workers' rights

**Numerous SMEs Nationwide**:
- Exploiting complex labor laws
- Disguised as "consensual resignation" or "recommended retirement"
- Depriving workers of legitimate rights

### The Information Gap Problem

| Employer Side | Worker Side |
|--------------|-------------|
| ✅ Professional labor consultant | ❌ No information |
| ✅ Rich legal knowledge | ❌ Difficult to understand complex system |
| ✅ Strategic response | ❌ Panicked immediate response |
| ✅ Time and resources | ❌ Emergency situation |

**Result**: Workers with legitimate rights don't receive unemployment benefits

## 💡 The Solution: AI Rights Guardian

### Core Features

#### 1. 🚨 Immediate Emergency Response

```

```

#### 2. ⚖️ Identify Unfair Situations

**Danger signals AI immediately warns about**:

- "If you agree to mutual resignation, I'll give you more severance"
- "Just sign here and it's done"
- "Other employees all did this way"
- "No legal problems, don't worry"

→ **Never sign! Need expert consultation immediately!**

#### 3. 📝 Evidence Collection Guide

```
Evidence Collection Checklist:

□ Recording
  - Use smartphone recording app
  - Legal when you're part of the conversation
  - Note date and time

```bash
# Clone Azure AI Chat template (provides basic structure)
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-chat.git unemployment-assistant
cd unemployment-assistant

# Or use the complete project (to be updated after deployment)
# git clone https://github.com/Power-Platform-Users-Korea/ImagineCup.git
# cd ImagineCup/2026-imagine-cup/unemployment-assistant
```

### Step 2: Create Custom Directories

```bash
mkdir prompts
mkdir data
mkdir logs
```

### Step 3: Create System Prompt

Create `prompts/unemployment_assistant.md`:

## 📊 Cost Analysis

### Traditional Method vs AI Assistant

| Item | Traditional | AI Assistant |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Labor Attorney** | ₩200,000-500,000 | Free |
| **Wait Time** | Days to weeks | Immediate |

| **Evidence Guide** | After-the-fact | Preventive |
| **Monthly Operation** | - | ₩30,000-50,000 |

### ROI (Social Return on Investment)

> **Note**: ROI is based on total protected unemployment benefits, representing social value rather than direct revenue.

**With ₩50,000/month operating cost** (Estimated):
- Can consult 100 workers (based on Azure OpenAI usage)
- Average unemployment benefit: ₩1,500,000 x 120 days = ~₩180,000,000
