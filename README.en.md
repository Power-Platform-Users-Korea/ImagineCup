- **Pitch Video**: Up to 3 minutes, impactful English presentation (storytelling + demo)

### 2. Analysis of Recent Winning Projects (2022~2025)
#### Common Success Patterns
- **Solving Real Problems**: Clear social pain points (environment, health, education, inclusion, etc.)
- **Active Use of AI/Cloud**: Azure, OpenAI, IoT, Computer Vision, NLP, and other MS technologies
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize a working core feature over a perfect product
- **Storytelling**: Clear flow from problem → solution → impact → vision
- **Team Diversity**: Roles split across development, planning, design, business, etc.

#### Example Winners
- **2025 Winner (USA)**: Real-time AI captions for the hearing impaired (Azure Speech, mobile app)

- **Social Impact**: Clearly define a problem relevant to Korea/global (climate, health, education, inclusion, etc.)
- **AI Utilization**: Use generative AI, responsible AI, and data ethics
- **Feasibility**: Design an MVP that can actually be built

#### 2) Team Building
- **Role Assignment**: Development (front/back/AI), planning, design, English presentation

#### 3) Technical Strategy
- **Leverage Microsoft Azure**: AI, ML, IoT, Web App, Database, etc.
- **Use OpenAI, Copilot, Power Platform, and latest MS services**
- **GitHub for Collaboration**: Code management, teamwork, CI/CD automation

#### 4) Presentation & Demo
- **Pitch Video**: 3 minutes, clear flow, real demo included
- **English**: Native fluency not required, but clear script and message are essential
- **Storytelling**: Emphasize real user/customer impact

#### 5) Documentation & Open Source
